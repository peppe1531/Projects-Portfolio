# Numerical Optimization Methods: implementation and validation of Nelder-Mead Method and Modified Newton Method

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of numerical optimization methods using MATLAB.  
The objective is to study and compare zero-order and second-order optimization methods by applying them to benchmark objective functions and analyzing their convergence behavior and performance.

The work combines theoretical understanding, algorithmic implementation, and experimental evaluation.

---

## Optimization Methods
The project includes the implementation and analysis of the following methods:

- **Nelder–Mead Method**, a zero-order optimization technique.
- **Modified Newton Method**, a second-order method enhanced to improve numerical stability and convergence properties.

---

## Implementation
The MATLAB implementation includes the core optimization algorithms, a set of objective functions used for testing, and a main script that runs the experiments and produces numerical results and visualizations.

Only a **clean and representative subset** of the MATLAB code is included in this repository in the directory 'src', focusing on the essential components needed to understand the optimization procedures.

## Report
The complete project report provides a detailed description of:
- the mathematical formulation of the optimization methods,
- the algorithmic steps of each approach,
- the experimental setup,
- the numerical results and their interpretation.

The **full MATLAB implementation** used during development is included in the **appendix named 'Codes' of the report**, which serves as the authoritative reference for the project.

## Notes
This project was **developed individually**.
