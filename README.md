# Projects Portfolio

This repository collects a selection of **academic projects** developed during my studies, with a primary focus on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Numerical Methods, and Applied Linear Algebra**.

The projects showcase both **theoretical understanding** and **practical implementation**, ranging from data-driven machine learning pipelines to mathematically grounded numerical and optimization techniques.

## About the Portfolio

The goal of this portfolio is to present:
- a solid background in **machine learning and deep learning**
- strong proficiency in **linear algebra, probability, statistics, and numerical methods**
- the ability to design **end-to-end analytical pipelines**
- experience working on **both individual and group projects**
- a rigorous and transparent approach to problem solving

Each project is self-contained and documented with a dedicated README and a report describing the problem, methodology, and results.

## Collaboration and Contributions

This portfolio includes a combination of **individually developed projects** and **group or pair projects** completed in an academic setting.

For group or pair projects, each project README clearly specifies my personal contributions and responsibilities.  
Individual projects reflect my independent work, from problem formulation to implementation and analysis.

## Programming Languages and Libraries

Across the projects, the following programming languages and libraries are commonly used:
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MATLAB
- C / C++
- Data visualization libraries
